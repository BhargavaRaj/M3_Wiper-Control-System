## Requirements
### INTRODUCTION
The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it.     
### SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

STM32 CUBE IDE

COMPONENTS

STM32F4O7VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
## 4W's & 1H
### What
Windscreen wipers are necessary for maintaining sufficient view for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars.
### When
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
### Where 
It can be incorporated in car, trucks, etc
### Why 
To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.
### How 
By using STM32F407VG microprocessor
