## Requirements
### INTRODUCTION
The operational speed of a wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control system in accordance with frequencies. The pulse signal is digitally processed to provide a control signal. A wiper driver circuit receives the control signal and adjusts the operational speed or timing in line with it. This project is an wiper Control System. Ignition Key Position at ACC: The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs Wiper ON: Wiper is OFF: On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz Wiper OFF: Wiper is ON: The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2 Ignition Key Position at Lock: The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs

### What
Windscreen wipers are necessary for maintaining sufficient view for the driver, especially in modern high-speed cars.
### When
The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
### Where 
It can be incorporated in car, trucks, etc
### Why 
To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.
### How 
By using STM32F407VG microprocessor
