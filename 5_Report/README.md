# M3_Wiper-Control-System
## Abstract:
Wiper is an essential component that is used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. In spite of removing water from windscreen, this system also will be upgraded to an automatic control system by using a Peripheral Interface Controller and water sensor. The wiper system functions well according to the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field. In this project we will build manually controlled wiper control system. We built a wiper control system using STM32F4 Discovery board. Here we use builtin button and LEDs to operate or visualize the project. We will control onboard four LEDs of STM32F4 discovery board with a push button.
